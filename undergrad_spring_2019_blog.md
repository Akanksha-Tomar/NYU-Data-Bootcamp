**January 22, 2019: Welcome to Data Bootcamp...**

Welcome to Data Bootcamp!

This is a very exciting course…the world is awash in data and being able to (i) harness, (ii) analyze, and (iii) communicate the analysis in a compelling way are must have skills for today and for the future. Employers are looking for them and you will be a better employee. And I'm looking forward to helping you acquire these skills.

In less than a week we will have our first meeting and get the semester started. I want to reach out to you about some features of this course to help you prepare for the semester ahead.

(1) Read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/nyusterndatabootcamp/teaching_materials/raw/master/documents/bootcamp_syllabus.pdf). I’ve posted the syllabus for the upcoming semester at our course website:

[https://nyu.data-bootcamp.com/undergrad_outline.html](https://nyu.data-bootcamp.com/undergrad_outline.html)

This has information about important dates, texts, grading, etc. Please take some time to go over this prior to our first class meeting.

(2) Make sure you have a laptop computer you can bring to class and install your own programs on. This is a must. We will be writing programs in every class.

(3) Take the online survey. This link below:

has a survey for you to complete. Completing this will partially go towards your participation / professionalism grade.

(4) Explore the website. The website provides a bunch of information about the course, FAQ, data, code, etc.

I'm looking forward to meeting you all and a great semester!
